# Hiesenoether

Hiesenoether is an experimental programming language that explores how
guarantees like certainty, invariants, and debuggability become expensive
as programs grow in complexity.

Programs operate under a fixed energy budget. Energy must be spent to
stabilize values, enforce symmetry, and observe exact state. When energy
is scarce, uncertainty increases and execution order begins to matter.

This project focuses on language design and semantics rather than
performance. It is intended as a research and educational exercise.
